Currently, it&rsquo;s shut down for the week due to my in-laws being in town. My network closet heats up quickly with the door closed but it&rsquo;s too loud to keep open when they are here for a few days.</p><p>But back to the lab. Currently I&rsquo;m running 2 hosts, one with ESXi and the other with Unraid. I am running only a few VMs, all Linux based. I do have vCenter running, just because I like the interface better. I have home assistant running as an appliance VM. I also have Ubiquiti, Unifi, and Zabbix.</p><p>On the Unraid side, I have a bunch of docker containers. I have some running health checks, smtp relay, SyncThing, and Uptime Kuma, as well as a few others.</p><p>I also have a few physical &ldquo;servers&rdquo;. Namely, I have an old laptop running DNS services with Technitium DNS, providing ad blocking and malware blocking DNS to the whole network. I also have another old laptop running Plex, utilizing the mobile NVidia graphics card for transcoding.</p><p>My goals for my homelab are not really defined. I like to tinker with interesting projects. Previously, it was to have a place outside of production to test things for work, but my current employer has a test lab dedicated to stuff like that. Now, I do provide some services to my house, like DNS with ad blocking, but I&rsquo;m the only one who uses the services most of the time.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
