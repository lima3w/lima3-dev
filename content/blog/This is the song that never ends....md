Cuz here we go again, starting a new blog. This is less about the blog itself and more about trying new stuff. 

I saw the idea of using Obsidian as a notes editor and publishing it with Hugo via GitHub to a site for semi automated posts. We will see how that goes.

I tend to start the project and never finish it. Maybe this time I'll try this as a journal of my ideas in my homelab. Currently, it's shut down for the week due to my in-laws being in town. My network closet heats up quickly with the door closed but it's too loud to keep open when they are here for a few days. 

But back to the lab. Currently I'm running 2 hosts, one with ESXi and the other with Unraid. I am running only a few VMs, all Linux based. I do have vCenter running, just because I like the interface better. I have home assistant running as an appliance VM. I also have Ubiquiti, Unifi, and Zabbix. 

On the Unraid side, I have a bunch of docker containers. I have some running health checks, smtp relay, SyncThing, and Uptime Kuma, as well as a few others. 

I also have a few physical "servers". Namely, I have an old laptop running DNS services with Technitium DNS, providing ad blocking and malware blocking DNS to the whole network. I also have another old laptop running Plex, utilizing the mobile NVidia graphics card for transcoding. 

My goals for my homelab are not really defined. I like to tinker with interesting projects. Previously, it was to have a place outside of production to test things for work, but my current employer has a test lab dedicated to stuff like that. Now, I do provide some services to my house, like DNS with ad blocking, but I'm the only one who uses the services most of the time.
